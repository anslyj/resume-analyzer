AI Resume Scanner & Job Matching Platform
Project Overview
The AI Resume Scanner & Job Matching Platform is a production-ready, full-stack TypeScript application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes and discover relevant career opportunities through artificial intelligence. This web-based platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to analyze uploaded PDF resumes, extract valuable insights, and match candidates with real-time job postings from the market. The application features a clean, intuitive user interface built with React 19 and a robust backend powered by Node.js and Express, all deployed and accessible to users online.
Technical Architecture & Implementation
The platform is built on a modern TypeScript stack, ensuring type safety and maintainability across both frontend and backend codebases. The backend architecture follows a microservices-inspired pattern with distinct service layers: the Analysis Engine orchestrates the overall workflow, the Cerebras Service handles AI interactions, and the Adzuna Service manages job market data retrieval. This separation of concerns makes the codebase modular, testable, and scalable.
File handling is implemented using Multer for multipart form data processing, combined with PDF-Parse library to extract text content from uploaded PDF documents. This extracted text is then processed by the Cerebras AI API, which utilizes the Llama 4 Scout 17B Instruct model; a powerful large language model optimized for understanding and analyzing professional documents. The AI identifies key skills, assesses proficiency levels, highlights strengths, and generates actionable recommendations for improvement.
Core Features & Functionality
The platform offers three distinct analysis modes to accommodate different user needs. In "Resume Only" mode, users upload their PDF resume and receive comprehensive feedback including skill extraction, strength identification, areas for improvement, and personalized job recommendations fetched from Adzuna's live job database. The "Job Description" mode allows users to paste a job posting and receive tailored advice on how to optimize their resume for that specific role. The "Compare Both" mode provides the most detailed analysis, comparing the user's resume directly against a job description with a calculated match score ranging from 0 to 100, skill gap analysis, and specific recommendations to improve their candidacy.
The Adzuna Jobs API integration provides real-time access to thousands of job postings, particularly focusing on government positions. When analyzing resumes, the system intelligently generates search queries based on extracted skills and user-specified experience levels (entry, mid, senior), returning 20+ relevant job listings with calculated match scores, salary information, location details, and reasons why each position aligns with the candidate's profile.
Security & Data Management
Security is implemented through industry-standard practices including JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for session management and bcrypt for password hashing. The Express backend includes rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse and ensure fair resource allocation. User data, including authentication credentials and analysis history, is stored in MongoDB with Mongoose ODM providing schema validation and data modeling. Environment variables securely manage sensitive information like API keys for Cerebras and Adzuna services, database connection strings, and JWT secrets.
Deployment & Production Considerations
The application is fully deployed and accessible online, demonstrating real-world production capabilities. The deployment handles CORS configuration for secure cross-origin communication between the React frontend and Express backend, manages environment-specific configurations, and includes comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring. The system architecture supports concurrent requests, manages API rate limits from external services, and provides fallback mechanisms when AI services are temporarily unavailable, ensuring a reliable user experience even under varying conditions.
